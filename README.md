Caffeinated GitHub
==================

This is a Laravel 5.0 GitHub API Wrapper package that is heavily influenced by both KNP Labs [php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api) client and Graham Campbell's [Laravel-GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub) package. It's essentially a merger of the two packages born out of the need for more control over the code base for some personal projects. If you are looking to implement and make use of the GitHub API within your own application (Laravel or not), I highly recommend you skip over this package and go take a look at the two mentioned above.
